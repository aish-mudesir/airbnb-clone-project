# Team Roles

  Backend Developer

Description: Focuses on the server-side logic, APIs, and integration with the database.

Responsibility: Ensures that the application’s core functionality works correctly, builds RESTful APIs, handles authentication, and optimizes performance of server processes.

Frontend Developer

Description: Works on the client-side of the application, developing the user interface and ensuring a smooth user experience.

Responsibility: Translates design mockups into functional web pages or mobile screens, implements responsive layouts, and connects the UI to backend services.

Database Administrator (DBA)

Description: Manages and maintains the database systems used by the project.

Responsibility: Ensures data integrity, security, and performance; sets up backups, handles queries optimization, and maintains availability of the database.

Project Manager

Description: Oversees the entire project lifecycle and coordinates between teams.

Responsibility: Defines project goals, manages timelines and resources, facilitates communication between stakeholders, and ensures deliverables meet requirements.

# Technology stacks

    Django

Purpose in the project: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It provides tools for handling authentication, database integration, and creating RESTful APIs efficiently.

PostgreSQL

Purpose in the project: A powerful open-source relational database system. It is used to store, organize, and manage the project’s data securely and reliably.

GraphQL

Purpose in the project: A query language for APIs. It allows the frontend to request exactly the data it needs from the backend, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

Docker

Purpose in the project: A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

Git & GitHub/GitLab

Purpose in the project: Version control systems that enable collaborative coding. They track changes, manage different branches of the project, and allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase.

Graphene (if used with GraphQL + Django)

Purpose in the project: A library that integrates GraphQL with Django, allowing developers to build flexible APIs and connect them with Django models.

# Database Design

   Users

Important Fields:

user_id (unique identifier)

name (full name)

email (contact information)

password (encrypted login credential)

role (e.g., host, guest, admin)

Relationships: A user can list multiple properties, make multiple bookings, and leave reviews.

Properties

Important Fields:

property_id (unique identifier)

owner_id (links to user_id of the host)

title (property name/short description)

location (address or coordinates)

price_per_night

Relationships: A property belongs to one host (user) but can have many bookings and reviews.

Bookings

Important Fields:

booking_id (unique identifier)

user_id (who booked)

property_id (which property is booked)

check_in_date

check_out_date

Relationships: A booking belongs to one user and one property, and is associated with a payment.

Reviews

Important Fields:

review_id (unique identifier)

user_id (who wrote the review)

property_id (which property is being reviewed)

rating (e.g., 1–5 stars)

comment (feedback text)

Relationships: A review belongs to a user and a property. A property can have multiple reviews from different users.

Payments

Important Fields:

payment_id (unique identifier)

booking_id (linked to the booking)

amount (total paid)

payment_date

status (e.g., pending, completed, refunded)

Relationships: Each payment is linked to exactly one booking, but a booking can potentially have multiple payment attempts.

# Feature Breakdown

    User Management
This feature handles registration, login, authentication, and user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin). It ensures secure access to the system and allows users to manage their profiles and activities.

Property Management
Hosts can add, update, and remove property listings with details such as location, price, and availability. This feature ensures accurate and up-to-date information is available to potential guests.

Booking System
Guests can search for available properties, select dates, and make reservations. This feature ensures that bookings are tracked, availability is updated, and both users and hosts are notified.

Payment Processing
Integrates secure payment gateways to handle transactions for bookings. This feature ensures smooth financial operations and keeps track of payment status (completed, pending, or refunded).

Review & Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have booked. This feature enhances trust and transparency by helping future guests make informed decisions.

Search & Filtering
Allows users to search properties by location, price, amenities, and availability. This feature improves user experience by quickly connecting guests with the most relevant property options.

# API Security

    Authentication

Description: Secure login mechanisms (e.g., email/password with hashing, OAuth) will be implemented to verify user identities.

Importance: Prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only registered users can use the system. This protects sensitive data such as personal information and booking details.

Authorization

Description: Role-based access control (RBAC) will ensure that users only have access to features relevant to their role (e.g., host, guest, admin).

Importance: Protects the system from misuse by restricting actions—for example, only hosts can add properties, and only admins can manage system-wide settings.

Data Encryption

Description: All sensitive data (like passwords, payment details) will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS/SSL) and at rest (database encryption).

Importance: Ensures confidentiality of user data, preventing hackers from stealing or misusing sensitive information.

Rate Limiting & Throttling

Description: Limits the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a given timeframe.

Importance: Protects against brute force attacks and denial-of-service attempts, ensuring the platform remains available for legitimate users.

Secure Payment Processing

Description: Payment details will be handled through trusted third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), not stored directly in the system.

Importance: Reduces the risk of financial fraud, protects transaction integrity, and builds user trust in the platform.

Regular Security Audits & Logging

Description: Continuous monitoring, logging of user activity, and regular security audits will be performed.

Importance: Helps detect suspicious activity early, supports incident response, and ensures long-term system security.

# CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are automated workflows that help developers integrate code changes frequently, test them, and deploy updates reliably. CI ensures that every new change is automatically tested and verified, while CD automates deployment to staging or production environments.

Importance for the Project
They reduce human error, speed up development, and ensure that new features or bug fixes reach users faster and with fewer issues. This helps maintain code quality, improves collaboration across the team, and keeps the system stable during frequent updates.

Tools that Could Be Used

GitHub Actions / GitLab CI → for automating build, test, and deployment workflows.

Docker → for containerizing the application to ensure consistency across environments.

Jenkins → as an alternative CI/CD tool for managing complex workflows.

Kubernetes (if scaling is required) → for orchestrating containerized deployments.
